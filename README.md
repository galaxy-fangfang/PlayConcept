# AI to play Concept

[Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_(board_game)) is a board game where players must guess a word, a name or a phrase using pictures.

We would like to code an AI playing concept.
There are 2 roles:
* Encoder: select the pictures
* Decoder: retrieve the initial word, name or phrase.

The repository contains:
* encoder.py: skeleton of Python code for the encoder
* decoder.py: skeleton of Python code for the decoder
* codes.txt: words associated with each picture of the board
