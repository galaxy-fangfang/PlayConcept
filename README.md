# AI to play Concept

[Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_(board_game)) is a board game where players must guess a concept using pictures.

We would like to code an AI playing concept.
There are 2 roles:
* Encoder: select the pictures from a concept
* Decoder: retrieve the concept from the pictures

The repository contains:
* encoder.py -> skeleton of Python code for the encoder
* decoder.py -> skeleton of Python code for the decoder
* codes.csv -> words associated with each picture of the board
* list.txt -> list of 500 concepts to be guessed
* sublist.txt -> sublist of 20 concepts to be guessed
